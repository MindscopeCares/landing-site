const story = [
  "Growing up with dyslexia, I experienced firsthand the strain it places on not only the child but also on parents and schools that lack adequate resources to support a child's needs. Bouncing between schools made it difficult for me to keep up, and schools that didn't prepare me for the world ahead means that this is not just a problem I have researched it is an educational tension I have lived through.",
  "Going from tutor to tutor myself, while watching the families of dear friends get lost in the fight for their children's academic safety within the complex landscape of our education system, helped me understand from an early age that no amount of hard work, sacrifice, and goodwill can replace timely, well-resourced intervention.",
  "Over time, as such interventions began to reveal tangible improvements in my trajectory, I discovered programming and Computer Science. What started as a one-off summer camp experience eventually blossomed into a field of study that, for the first time, worked with my brain instead of against it. And with talent came an obligation — one I felt not just for myself, but for all those who poured into me to get me to that point.",
  "As I climbed, it became crucial for me to foster community and make a difference with my gift. This led me not only to meet my co-founders but to participate in HBCU hackathons where my peers could compete by using technology to solve some of the most pressing problems we face today. At one of these, the Morehouse President's Hackathon, I was brought back to the truth that got me here: hard work and goodwill cannot replace well-timed resources.",
  "And so it became our mission, first in that 36-hour hackathon, and eventually in a fully realized startup — to arm schools, parents, and districts with the resources to ensure that children in need are met with whatever care they require.",
